            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hello and welcome to Good Dog Go, LLC. My name is Stacey Plattenberger. I started Good Dog Go to provide a comprehensive and enriching dog walking experience for your beloved canine companions. Dogs are always learning whether or not we are actively teaching them. As a pet professional, part of my job is to make sure the right behaviors are being reinforced. Manners-minded dog walking means skills such as providing eye contact, waiting at doorways and corners, walking on a loose leash, and sitting (instead of jumping) will be positively reinforced through each and every interaction I have with your dog.</p>
            <p>Services with Good Dog Go are meant to compliment training guided by a professional dog trainer, not to replace it. See Resources page for referrals. </p>
            <p>Good Dog Go provides services for the Washington Square neighborhood of Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>I am insured and bonded through the Business Insurers of the Carolinas via my membership with Pet Sitters International (PSI). Additionally, I have been Pet First Aid Certified through the American Red Cross.</p>
